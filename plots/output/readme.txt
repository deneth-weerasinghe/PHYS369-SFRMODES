##########################################

basic_absmag_z - absolute i-band magnitude against redshift, NO error bars, unfiltered redshift
absmag_z_err2 - absolute i-band magnitude against redshift, WITH error bars, unfiltered redshift
diff_absmag_z - absolute magnitude using all 3 infrared bands we selected (i, z, k) against redshift, NO error bars, unfiltered redshift
sfr_mass_combined_unfiltered - sfr against stellar mass for all stages, NO error bars
sfr_mass_combined_unfiltered_shapes - same as above, but with improved readability
sfr_mass_filtered_subplots - sfr against stellar mass, four stages separated on own plots, volume filtered, NO error bars
stage_{i}, i = 1,2,3,4 - sfr against stellar mass, separate images for each stages, with histograms and contour lines. Contour lines correspond to 68%, 90% and 95%.
